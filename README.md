# CountdownTimer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.

## Development server

After cloning the repository to your local environment run `npm i` to install the dependencies and then `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Adding user localization for the date format and adding the option to pick time could improve this project as properly localized content would feel as if it were designed and created for users no matter what language they speak.
